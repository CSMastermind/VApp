    		<LineBreak/>
    		<Run Text="Veterans who receive their health care through VA are much more likely to smoke and use tobacco than the rest of the U.S. population. They also are heavier smokers and have higher rates of smoking-related illnesses. Many veterans have told us that they first began smoking in the military. In fact, during World War II and the Korean War, cigarettes were often provided free as part of K- rations. Many in the military thought then that smoking was a good way to help keep soldiers alert and awake in the battlefield and the command, &quot;smoke 'em if you got 'em&quot; is one that many older veterans remember. Recruits may have even been able to earn smoking breaks during military training and boot camp. Unfortunately, this early tobacco use led quickly to a lifetime addiction and a wide list of health-related problems."/>

VA is committed to offering spiritual care as part of your treatment, if it is something you want. This Spirituality Center might help you decide if you want spiritual care from a VA chaplain.
